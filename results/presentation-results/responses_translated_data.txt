 [1] "I think of all the opportunities we have and who could easily be implemented but as due to policy lack of initiative lack of innovation and most of all lack of long-term thinking is not discussed and far less carried out why does not say that e.g. after-insulation of houses can be implementedVAT-free?Many more would have done this of their own interest when such things do not happen begins one to wonder what politicians really think what is or how serious is climate change really?If this is so important (something I believe in), one should initiate immediate action to lead the people in the right direction and do not care so much about the people at the same time actually serving on the measures the lack of such thinking contributes big to politician consumption andUnnoticed residents there is a dangerous development for a people and nation in full"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 [2] "I think first and foremost that this happens from the nature of nature, I think that there are many who are looking to make money talking about man-made climate change clean locally as for example when I lived in [] a period and took walks by [] Have I felt that many people think of themselves rather than the environment and I think of and to the same here in [] even if it will in anyway will be entirely on the face of a good time ahead if people take public transport or the car by looking at it Big picture I think that emissions in rivers and this stroke should be stated too good to this should be punished much harder than it is done today at all I want high penalties for anyone who conducts pollution whatever scale [] is for me a dirty HÃ¸l and I do not realize that it is not made more I understand it simply not there are such things that for me do that I get less and less faith in man when I read about / watching TV about the rubbish that sent to parts of Africa Do I get a ski Ig stated just that is for me completely incomprehensible children who pick on old PCs etc to sell the little they manage to recover further for some scarves that may be complicated to put an end to this but one must put action in many joints here and the needs that are created for the consumer community should jack down 10 notches I am also drittlei of seeing the word climate change for man is hopelessly corrupt man can never fix this one realizes that many really burn to do things better for us all but when Then also a whole brew of idiots out there is not much hope"
